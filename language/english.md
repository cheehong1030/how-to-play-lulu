## ðŸ—¡Lulu's item
If there is a lot of Heal on the opposite side, such as soraka, senna, you need to buy small anti heal item after buying shoes  
When the sp item is upgraded, you need to take a scan. If the opposite jungler often comes to the bottom road, you need to buy a sentry

## ðŸ’£ Lulu's skills
Raise E first, then main E and negative W because Q skill does not benefit much  
And adc can also get more shields in the early stage to ensure better blood volume in early fights

## ðŸ›  Lulu's Tips
If there is a rushing assassin, try to keep W and give W to  assassin ensure that adc will not give oneshot  
In teamfights, make sure you're next to the adc instead not behind, to ensure the adc's output  
Try to give all skills to adc to keep adc in a better HP to output
